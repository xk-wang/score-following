All pieces were recorded using an untuned Yamaha U3 Disklavier at the Media and Arts Technology Lab, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, UK. The dataset contains recordings with some performance mistakes, as well as midi annotation of all the mistakes made by the performer.


Each piece is linked to the following files:
1) Disklavier_*.wav: 		recording of the piece, containing mistakes
2) Disklavier_*_correct.mid:		midi file with correct notes, aligned to the .wav performance
3) Disklavier_*_missed.mid: 	midi file containing the missed notes, not present in the recording (aligned)
4) Disklavier_*_fa.mid:		midi file containing the extra played notes (false alarms) in the recording (aligned)
5) Score_*.mid: 		midi file with the non-aligned original score of the piece
